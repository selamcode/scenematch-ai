# üóìÔ∏è SceneMatch AI Project ‚Äì Weekly Progress Tracker

> This project follows a modular breakdown of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Begin with a prototype in Module 1 and then progressively upgrade its core components (vector search, evaluation, monitoring, and optimization). The final capstone brings everything together into a complete system ‚Äî SceneMatch AI, a smart movie recommendation assistant.

| Week | Module        | Deliverable                                    | What Needs to Be Done                                                    | What We Will Do (SceneMatch AI)                                                        | Progress | Comments                         |

| 1    | Intro to LLMs + RAG | Basic RAG prototype setup                         | Understand RAG concept, set up LLM + retriever + basic search             | Connect OpenAI API + Elasticsearch to perform search-based movie scene recommendations | ‚è≥        | - preparing data     - data cleaned - JSON data ready                            |
| 2    | Vector Search  | Add vector search using Qdrant                 | Learn about embeddings, vector DBs, indexing                             | Extract scene embeddings and store them in Qdrant for semantic search                  | ‚è≥        |                                  |
| 3    | Evaluation     | Build evaluation dataset + offline evaluation | Design test queries, relevance labels, measure retrieval quality         | Create a test set of scene queries + evaluate response quality (e.g., recall, MRR)     | ‚¨ú        |                                  |
| 4    | Monitoring     | Track user interactions                       | Log user search activity and responses, optionally build a dashboard     | Log feedback from user queries and create simple usage stats (file or dashboard)       | ‚¨ú        |                                  |
| 5    | Best Practices | Hybrid search and reranking                   | Combine BM25 and vector search; implement reranker for better quality    | Apply hybrid search and rerank scenes using prompt-based scoring or similarity metrics | ‚¨ú        |                                  |
| 6    | Bonus Project  | Stitch together full pipeline                 | Integrate LLM, vector DB, retriever, reranker, and feedback system       | Finalize pipeline that takes input, retrieves scenes, ranks them, and generates output | ‚¨ú        |                                  |
| 7    | Capstone       | Final polish and documentation                | Test the full system, evaluate thoroughly, write docs                    | Make the system deployable or demo-ready with README, examples, and test results       | ‚¨ú        |                                  |
